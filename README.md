# VeglegesFilmKolcsonzoApp

This is a demo project, to practice C#.

The main target is to have a login page, where the user can log in. After that it should navigate to the list of films from the local mysql database.

My future plans are:
- Show pictures for the movies, not only the title
- Make a system where the user can rent a movie
- Make suggestions based on recently rented films
